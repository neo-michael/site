        <h3>Diet Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Eat a Balanced Diet:</strong> Include a variety of fruits,
            vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to provide essential
            nutrients and maintain energy levels throughout the day.

            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose Whole Grains:</strong> Opt for whole grains like
            brown rice, oats, and whole-wheat bread instead of refined grains.
            They offer more fiber and help with digestion and blood sugar
            control.

            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limit Added Sugars and Sodium:</strong> Reduce sugary foods
            and beverages, and limit sodium intake to lower the risk of heart
            disease and high blood pressure.

            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water to support
            digestion, energy levels, and overall health. Proper hydration also
            improves exercise performance and prevents dehydration.

        </ul>

        <h3>Exercise Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Incorporate Strength and Cardio:</strong> Aim for both
            endurance (e.g., running, cycling) and strength training (e.g.,
            weightlifting) to improve muscle mass, stamina, and cardiovascular
            health.

            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exercise Regularly:</strong> Aim for at least 150 minutes of
            moderate-intensity exercise per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous
            exercise, to support overall health.

            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus on Flexibility and Balance:</strong> Include exercises
            like yoga or tai chi to improve flexibility and balance, which can
            enhance mobility and prevent falls.

            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rest and Recover:</strong> Allow time for recovery between
            workouts to avoid injury and promote muscle repair. Rest is just as
            important as the exercise itself.
